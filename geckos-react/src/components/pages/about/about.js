        <p>
        We have not got any  information about him to put  here, 
        but I am very sure he is
        a very nice guy, not only because
        he is the Project Manager of our team,
        but because if you have any question
        you just tell him and out of nowhere
        he would get you the space, yet, we are still waiting for his oficial info...

        <h4>Front End Web Developer</h4>
        <p> His reason for joining Chingu
        and doing this project is to learn
        new technologies and more about the
        backend of an application. Also to learn
        how to effectively work  and contribute in a remote team.
        When Iâ€™m not coding I enjoy <em> playing guitar, video games,
        reading or scouring Netflix with my girlfriend </em>for something new to watch.</p></div>
